# AWS_ScoutSuite_Rules

These are rules ('findings') and modified rulesets I've created for ScoutSuite, the open-source cloud auditing tool. 

These rules are for AWS and are meant to replicate rules that are found in AWS Config. While ScoutSuite covers some of what Config covers, and then some, it also lacks some of the AWS managed rules found in Config. I had to recreate these rules for ScoutSuite as part of a project I was involved in. 

Feel free to add these rules to your own ScoutSuite deployments, vet them, and add them to your custom ruleset.
